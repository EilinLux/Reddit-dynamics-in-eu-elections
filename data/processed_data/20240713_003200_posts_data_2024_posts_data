a Swedish perspective:\n\n- This is the first time that SD get *smaller* in an election. They decided to campaign by picking a fight with TV4, the biggest private media company, who had exposed them using anonymous accounts on social media to spread propaganda. This included sending a mass text on the day before the election which attacked TV4. Unclear if that strategy limited the damage of the original expose or made it worse. Another part to this is that they are essentially part of the ruling government coalition which isn't super popular (nothing extreme, just normal government incompetence). Anyway from a Swedish perspective this is probably the single biggest shock of the election.\n\n- Second biggest is that the Greens beat expectations and got bigger than SD. They did a couple of great elections around 2010 but have barely managed to get into parlament since then. It's possible that they were the main outlet for anti-government votes. Probably also helped by their new leader who's relatively well-liked. Their former well-liked leader was also on the EU ticket which probably helped. Apart from that the Greens generally do well in EU elections.\n\n- About the same as above for the Left party which are looking at over 10%. Probably also because their very popular former party leader is top of the ticket to the EU.\n\n- Christians (KD - gov), Liberals (L - gov) and Green Liberals (C - opposition) all managed to get over 4% so presumably no immediate leadership changes.\n\nAll in all the left are the big winners with (S, MP, V) getting almost 50% which hasn't happened for years. Bad news for the ruling coalition as a whole.", "Here you can see how every region and municipality voted: https://resultat.val.se/euval2024/EU?r=P&t=0", "Finally an election post that isn't depressing", "I'm glad L made it over 4% (required to get a mandate). They're doing a shit job on a national level, which is probably why they are getting bad results. But on the EU level they're actually doing a good job voting for impactful environmental legislation and many other good things imo. She's just not very charismatic though.", "Looks like I was a Swede all this time", "My beloved Sweden once again giving me hope.", "Nordic countries all turning more left/green, it's nice to see", "SD (the far right party) was exposed for spreading disinformation on secret social media bot accounts. They spent the entire election campaign crying about the \"election interference\" by the TV4 expos\u00e9 rather than actually campaigning. In addition a spoiler party named the \"People's list\" ran and recieved about 1% of the vote, largely from SD.\n\nThe Greens and Socialist Party (MP and V) likely took alot of young and more left-wing voters from the lackluster Social Democrats (S) campaign, while S took older centre-right voters unhappy with their collaboration with SD at the national level.\n\nI don't think this will carry over to the General in 2026. If the right's promises in 2022 of lowering crime, immigration and inflation succeed they will get re-elected. If they don't, the left will cease power again.\n\nRight now crime is as bad as ever (however it's so normal that it doesn't even make headlines anymore, likely giving an impression of success), immigration is lowering (due to fewer immigrants wanting to come here because of how fucked this country is) and the economy is slowly stabilising to pre 2020 levels.\n\nTl:dr - The far-right has stagnated in polling as they have gained power while losing in the EU elections due to their lackluster campaigning and spoiler candidates. This country is fucked though.", "I am super happy that my party grew the most. Just hoping it holds out and similar growth transfers to the general election.", "Does v\u00e4nsterpartiet translate somewhat to \"windowparty\"? At least if I translate it to Dutch it would look very similar to Vensterpartij. With all big names I can imagine what they represent, except for this one.

It feels like the last hold against corporate personal data mining.", "Sweden was the first EU country where the far right actually got into government and guess what, this is the first election since their rise of the last 15 years where they have lost support....\n\nThe blinkers are coming of.\n\nRussia is actually a bigger threat than a few Islamic nutjobs", "Thanks Sweden, nice to see those results after what happened in France", "Happy to see that lots of people value our only earth. Without nature we are nothing.", "The Swedish people are amongst a very rare group of people, those who know how to use their brain. Finally a not depressing result.

Not that a lot of people are actively against the EU and us being members, far from it. The interest in the EU is just low.\n\nShift in mandates: the former communist party gained one and the evangelical party lost one. That's all. Some say this is turning left, but I doubt it.\n\nI don't know the situation in other countries, but in Sweden the candidates are not that interesting. It used to be almost only has beens. Or candidates who mean nothing to most Swedes, such as Carl Bildt's Italian wife.", "The language used so similar to Sanskrit, no doubt there was a proto-indo-european common tribe", "Far right politics can't win without the incompetence of the left, just care about people concerns and see how easily things change, In my opinion the left is the one at the most blame here, been in power for years and absolutely don't care about their voters and concerns.", "\ud83d\udc4f", "Swedish nazis are yellow, right?", "Are these final?

I feel like lot of my friends, who are also not swedes vote similarly, but cannot get counted toward national elections.", "My personal analysis regarding SD's results is that the agenda discovery played next to 0 matter in the results. Afaik some study showed that their supporters didn't care much at all, and the reaction was mostly from opposing parties. But rather that they just don't have a strong stance on EU politics since they've previously been pro-swexit thus removing support from EU-friendly people, and their recent switch to not support swexit made the non-EU friendly people turn their back on them.\n\nBasically, they just dont have a good attraction from either side.", ">Another part to this is that they are essentially part of the ruling government coalition which isn't super popular (nothing extreme, just normal government incompetence). \n\nThis isn't true. SD has not become less popular on a national level since becoming a part of the ruling government coalition, according to election surveys. They are still at 20%. Moderaterna (M), the other major party of government coalition, has gained slightly in popularity since the last national election. It's only the two smaller government parties, KD and L, who are doing poorly. \n\nSource: https://novus.se/valjarbarometer-arkiv/2024-05-novus-valjarbarometer/", "[deleted]", "Only 50% turnout :(\n\nThat is lower then the last election when we had 55.27%", "In the village I was born C became the biggest party.

For the past 10-15 years leftists political parties destroyed sense of safety/security for most of the citizens of these countries by absolutely uncontrolled and pointless mass migration that should've been managed better. It's crazy how young people do not understand democracy. For many leftists if the left wing parties win then it's a democracy but whenever it's the right wing that wins then it's rigged elections and apocalypse.

Being anti-EU at this point doesn\u2019t feel very popular in Sweden as many believe we need to stick together strong with the rest of Europe. We have record strong support for EU in Sweden. \n\nAnd one of the most important questions for voters has been climate. SD being vocal about basically how much they don\u2019t like any of the climate change work being done in EU is not going to be popular with a lot of voters as well. Also they come across really childish and stand-offish when posed with questions about the anonymous accounts, particularly the top candidate. They came across as wildcards in the EU in a time where a lot of people want stable and united. It\u2019s still not a bad result though, immigration is obviously still an important topic for voters.\n\nThe difference between Green Party in national vs EU election is actually insane. Imagine how different things can go for parties if they only select representatives that are likable..", "Sweden is not \"fucked\" - what kind of bubble are you living in?", "I really don't think \"because of how fucked this country is\" is the main reason we have lower immigration lol. And even if it were, that would be quite sad because of how things really aren't fucked at all on an international level", ">I don't think this will carry over to the General in 2026. If the right's promises in 2022 of lowering crime, immigration and inflation succeed they will get re-elected. If they don't, the left will cease power again.\n\nYou're right. The right-wing government got elected to solve these domestic issues, so it shouldn't come as a suprise that they perform badly in an election where these issues aren't present.", "I would not vote for SD in times like these. Them saying \"there is a limit how much we can spend on Ukraine\" is a true statement but I  don't think its a good  thing to say now. In combination that the \"Group\" they belong to is  pretty shattered when it comes to Russia. \n\nThat being said. I think your comment has some minor misinformation. \n\n> SD (the far right party) was exposed for spreading disinformation on secret social media bot accounts\n\nAnonymous accounts, not bot accounts.

People aren\u2019t having kids or settling down to buy a home and this isn\u2019t by choice - the cost of modernity has become too high and nearly two decades of austerity, wage freezes, and rampant inflation has priced the youth out of their own countries. Add Covid and the sociological fall out of the 2008 recession are compounded. \n\nOur entire political system is built on a type of liberal market based economic theory. If you cut immigration then you have to fix demographic decline directly and this means the systemic issues economic we all face would have to be resolved one way or another. This would come at the cost of those profiting and lobbying to keep the system as it is. It would also result in political parties having to navigate and adapt to a new world of voting patterns and social demands. \n\nImmigration is simply too easy of a fix for what is really a gigantic and existential issue. Modernity has failed us and those who enjoyed it are set up to retire and pop their mortal coil having lived a life where they could afford a family, they could afford to have hobbies, a social life, go to clubs, bars, holidays abroad, own a home, have a family, have a stay at home mother, and have a career where they earned a fair wage which correlated to living costs and inflation. Politicians will ride out their careers on the backs of those content voters who want it all to stay the same because they\u2019re all set for life. \n\nAnother thing that is impersonal which I think is important is the idea of democracy, or more importantly where did it come from? It came from the European Enlightenment, it came from Kant, and is currently only in existence in a minority of the world. The average human experience is not one in a democratic country. If in 200 years Europe is forever changed and now no different to the rest of the world how long will humanity have to wait before another Enlightenment comes along? \n\nGiven the current trajectory of social media,  AI and surveillance technology is an Enlightenment even possible again if the future regimes will control all information and communication? Will a future Kant write his thesis with a pen and paper having forgone technology because it\u2019s now a tool of some despot? The less democratic the world is the worst it is for humanity. With the way politics are trending in Europe illiberal regimes of one form or the other might become the norm because politicians can\u2019t face up to the reality that the liberal dream failed us all and people are now looking for a way out of the system - they want someone radical who will promise to change it all and they won\u2019t. They will make it worse.\n\nChange everything or keep it the same and keep importing cheap labour - you pick. Fukuyama said history ended when the Berlin Wall fell.

In the population-based cancer registry of the Saarland, retrieval by reported nationality yielded only 38% (95% confidence interval (CI): 31-45%) of the estimated number of Turkish cases in the registry; furthermore, nationality information was found to be inaccurate, and completeness dependent on the vital status of cases.

Combining the two sources in a capture-recapture approach yielded 91% (95% CI: 86-94%) of the estimated total number of Turkish cases.

I feel like neural networks (AI) will be the point where this world will start dragging our physical reality with it.\n\nI imagine that all the difficult things like fusion, room temperature superconductors, etc. will be cracked in a decade because we can simulate them in this alternative layer instead of having to try out each iteration in the real world. Innovation has become infinitely cheaper. \n\nLong story short, if material science and robotics start advancing at this pace, we will simply not need physical labor anymore. The only reason to have jobs like this is because people might still prefer to interact with other people. Of course because of real world economics, there will be a transition period. We'll see how long it is. \n\nThe kind of change in the job market from before, where instead of me hitting a piece of metal, now I press a button on a machine to hit the metal won't apply this time. Elon Musk has already tried building a fully automated factory (and failed). The fact that we could attempt something like that is very telling. \n\nI hope you are right or that at least this will be a slow process because: no jobs -> no money -> no consumers -> no economy as we know it.\n\nCan I ask what you mean by the school system not being meritocracy?

Four years later in the November elections, which is considered to be the last truly free election in Germany, they won 33%, down from 37% in the summer. So we can either accept that the Great Depression which started in 29 had a profound effect on Germans driving a third of them into desperation. Or we can conclude that at least a third of Germans were deeply racist and xenophobia driven, but somehow they waited until the elections in 32 to come out as racist, even though various ultra right parties had been active in Germany as early as 1918.\n\nBut most telling is the fact that they got 2.6% in 1928, then the Great Depression started in 1929 and then they jumped up to 18.2% in 1930.", "I think that those people have been convinced by propaganda to sit down and let the others decide.\n\n\nYou can win in 2 ways: either you convince people to vote for you or you convince people not to vote for the others.\n\n\nPeople gave their lives for centuries to allow you to vote and not have a king.

I'm sorry. It's immigrants fault.", "Explain me your point of view.", "And maybe it does take away the need for workers, but that could also be a good thing.\n\nDuring the industrial revolution, it wasn't uncommon to work for 12 hours per day for 6-7 days a week just to feed and house yourself. That's basically not a thing anymore in Europe.\n\nIf those developments take away labor, then we just need to work less.\n\nAnd the total automation of labor is still not that likely. We have a lot of technology that could automate a lot of stuff, but we rarely use it. Let's use housing as an example. We've had housing that's produced in a factory and which then gets delivered and quickly assembled for more than a century, we've had housing that mostly just consists of building blocks which get combined to quickly build a lot of houses for many decades, we've had 3d printed houses for a few years, etc. \nAnd yet, the vast majority of people build houses the traditional way.\n\nI don't think that the automation of labor will happen in the near future. Maybe some jobs will be cut, but a lot of them will probably continue to be used for many decades. \n\nBut let's say you're right and we actually manage to automate away all labor. Then why should we not let more people in? If we can effortlessly produce everything that those people need, then the only moral decision is to give it to them. \n\nIf we have that technology, then we could also just help other countries to build similar technologies, which would massively reduce the amount of problems that would force people out of their countries and would thus reduce the amount of immigrants altogether. \n\n>Can I ask what you mean by the school system not being meritocracy? How does this affect the immigrants?\n\nThe level of education that the parents have, their wealth and whether the parents are migrants are all things that heavily impact the level of education that children will achieve.\n\nGermany is exceptionally bad here, but the same thing applies to basically all countries. \n\nHere in Germany, if you have two parents that have an Abitur (the thing you need to qualify for university) and your household makes more than 5000\u20ac per month, then the chance of getting an abitur is 81% If neither parent has an abitur and your household makes less than 2600\u20ac per month, then your chances are just 21%.\n\nWhether you're a migrant is also important. At the extremes (>5000\u20ac per month or <2600\u20ac per month) it doesn't matter that much (it still makes a difference, but it's less than half a percent), but if your household makes ~4000\u20ac per month and none of your parents have an Abitur, then the chances of getting one is 36% if you don't have immigrant parents and 31% if you do.\n\n#\n\nAnd since migrants generally have a worse education and don't have a lot of money, our school system is heavily stacked against their children", "yeah i know i'm french.\nBut as every media and r/France is treating it they are both far right.\nThat's why you got me lost.\nFrance is i think the only country with a pro-european far right party", "Fair enough.", "Migrants are going to be those countries\u2018 safety net.

They are numbered and noted against your name, so in case of any alleged malarkey a court can order for it to be traced and verified.", "There are flaws and risks in every possible method of election. The question is what is the severity of the risk, being combined from the likelihood of the risk and the potential impact of the risk, what are the possible risk mitigation methods and what level of risk you are willing to accept.\n\nI am not a proponent of online voting and I will personally vote on a paper ballot in a voting station. That said, most of the arguments presented here against online voting are on thin ice.\n\nRegarding the secrecy of the ballot, yes, online voting opens a risk that someone can see who you are voting for (be it by physically standing next to you or by being able to track your computer screen). This is something that we do not want to happen, as it can undermine the free nature of election and its legitimacy.\n\nI will briefly touch upon three general ways your ballot secrecy could be undermined in this online voting system and what the corresponding risk mitigation factors are.\n\na) your vote is intercepted by someone \"in the server\" are he learns who you are voting for.\n\nFor all intents and purposes, this is \"impossible\", as your vote is cryptographically sealed, analogous to how postal voting works, except instead of a physical seal on a double envelope, it is cryptographically sealed by your state issued ID card. It is of course not technically impossible for someone to break this, but:\n\n- with current computing capabilities it is not possible if the key generation process is correct\n\n- if the key generation process is not correct and the ID card is faulty, then there are WAY BIGGER issues than someone being able who you voted for (basically it could create a risk that any digitally signed contract is legally challenged).\n\n- our state has a proven track record of taking such risks extremely seriously and the one time the process was proven to be vulnerable to attacks, our state immediately closed the vulnerable ID cards and issued both software updates as well as new ID cards without the vulnerability.\n\nIn this regard the risk (along with mitigation methods) is lesser than with postal voting (where someone could physically open your envelope) and is not a reason to shy away from online voting.\n\nb) Your computer is infected with malware that visually traces your screen, so as to learn who you voted for.\n\nThis is possible. But relatively unlikely if proper risk mitigation is applied.\n\n- Every voter (and computer user) has personal responsibility to keep their computer clean and up to date in its software.\n\n- Such malware, if present, poses much greater risks (such as direct financial risks) than someone being able to see who you voted for. Thus it is a risk that is \"subsumed\" by a greater risk that we accept as a society.\n\n- if you suspect your vote has been compromised, you can recast your vote that I'll get to in more detail in the next paragraph.\n\nIn total, this specific risk is real, but manageable through proper digital hygiene and in line with generally accepted risk levels in society.\n\nc) Someone physically stands next to you or even worse, using your ID card and codes casts the vote in stead of you.\n\nIt is a real risk and something that has almost certainly happened (unlike points a and b that have probably not happened). It is also a greater risk than simply being seen who you vote for, because someone can actually cast your vote himself instead, if they have your ID card and codes.\n\n- mitigation factor nr 1 is that such activity is illegal and unlike an anonymous hacker, the perpetrator of this crime is apparent to the victim.\n\n- You can recast your vote, either by another digital vote or by voting in the voting station on paper. Only the last vote counts. So if someone coerces you to vote for someone, you can, at least by the voting regulation, change your vote later.\n\n- It is unlikely that you are being held hostage to cast a vote, and if you are, there are greater issues than one stolen vote. The realistic risk is that you would be manipulated to vote for someone in more softer ways.\n\nIn general this is a real risk, but with the mitigation processes in effect it is a somewhat larger risk than your wife-beater husband demanding you take a photo of your ballot in the voting station or they'll beat you up at home. I.e something that we take as an acceptable risk in paper ballot voting.\n\n  \nWe have to accept some form of risk in any voting process. With proper risk mitigation, the risk of breaching your ballot secrecy is roughly in line with the risk we accept in paper balloting. Feel free to have a different risk tolerance.", "A very brief summary of how it works is that they use a \"double envelope system\" where the vote is first encrypted using a public key acquired from the voting system. This creates the first \"envelope\" around the voting payload. Then, the voter uses their personal private key to encrypt the voting payload again, thus \"putting the envelope in another envelope, both of which are locked with different locks.\"\n\n\nOn the server, the outer envelope is first removed from all votes, i.e. the persons who participated in the voting are identified, and their signatures are verified.  The inner envelopes are then forwarded to the server, where they are decrypted using the election's private key, and the votes are counted.  It should be noted here that the first server does not have the private key of the election, so it cannot open the encrypted votes, and only the inner envelopes representing the anonymous votes reach the second server.\n\nThe system was further improved in 2017, adding another layer to further secure anonymity, using MixNet, but I won't get into that here.", "And on an even more basic level how do you insure someone, like a controlling spouse isn\u2019t standing behind their back?

Just as with postal voting, there are many ways that voting can be compromised.  Someone can pay you for your vote, with payment made in exchange for proof of how you voted (e.g. photo or screen shot).  An abusive partner can look over your shoulder and force you to vote a certain way.

You just have to decide whether the upsides are worth it to you.", "> Wow, things must be really shit at Spain if banks get hacked all the time...\n\nWow, you're so ignorant and naive if you think that doesn't happen in your country.\n\nFor example:\nhttps://news.err.ee/1609270680/cyber-incident-at-security-firm-hansab-banking-services-working-in-estonia\n\nThe Estonian e-state:\nhttps://e-estonia.com/estonian-e-state-has-experienced-several-hacking-incidents-as-of-late-what-are-the-lessons-learned/\n\nAnother one this year: \nhttps://news.err.ee/1609278921/ria-estonia-s-state-institutions-hit-by-largest-cyberattack-to-date\n\nYou've been brainwashed or something to not know that any computer connected to the internet is subject of cyberattacks of all kinds.\n\nPlease stop talking as if your country is so special, it's unhackable and the rest of the world is stupid. You're being  ridiculous.\n\n> As for our e-voting system the vote gets an added random number, signed with digital signature, encrypted with public key and sent to collection server, collection server timestamps the vote.\n\nNice, so anyone who has access to those servers can potentially know who you voted for and use it against you. And you would never know. Or you'd know and you could do nothing about it.\n\n> All those steps are checked by observers and auditors.\n\nSo you think you can bribe tens of thousands of random citizens around the country, plus anyone who assist to the counts because they're public, plus the volunteers from different political parties, but you can't bribe a bunch of people who control it all in Estonia................................................................\n\n> E-voting is equal to in-person voting\n\nNo. I can see my vote going into a box, I can touch it, and I know there's people in custody until that box is opened and counted in public. It is 100% anonymous and I know my vote is in the box and I can see how they count it. \n\nIn e-vote, first you can't be 100% sure of the identity, nobody is personally checking, someone could steal your identity and vote for you, then you have to trust that your vote has been counted and it was added to the party that you chose, and you have to trust that nobody is collecting your info, and for that, you have only blind trust, you have absolutely no way to check it. You press the button and you don't know what happens after that.\n \n> What do you mean there are ways to know how much money you had and that someone stole it? If it was an inside job, then there wouldn't be a trace of money ever existing on your account.\n\nI have an account in a bank, and for sure my bank has several servers, and for sure my bank has backup of the info if anything is stolen, and there's a place where there's my name John Smith and my funds 10 million euros. If someone steals it, I will notice, my bank will notice.\n\nYou can't do the same with e-voting if you keep it anonymous. But anyway, it's obvious voting is not anonymous in Estonia. You have to send your name and your personal vote through the internet, and that info is collected by a computer, that'd be illegal in most of Europe just that, because voting is anonymous, at least in Spain. You can say it's encrypted, protected, hidden, you can say all you want. Your government is receiving that information and they can decrypt it, that's how they know that you voted and who you voted.\n\nI'm not going to answer any more ridiculous statements. If you're not aware of the risks of the internet, it's your problem. If you think your government won't lie to you, it's your problem. If you don't care if someone could collect the information of your vote, it's also your problem. Don't talk to me about 100% cybersecurity in Estonia because such thing does not exist, not in Estonia, not anywhere else.", "I think you'd have to be stupid to trust that a computer can't be hacked and that your government and the future governments that you still don't know won't use it against you.", "Your pin-codes are in a computer, just like your name and your vote.\n\nComputers can be hacked. Cards can be hacked. Identities can be stolen.", "There are a lot of flaws. The biggest one is that you have to trust that your government is not going to manipulate it or collect info to use it against you.", "There are different people from different political parties, plus random people, checking that that's not happening.\n\nAlso, every little group of people control a very little number of votes, so even if you get to convince the 3 random citizens responsible for a ballot box, which is already very difficult, plus the representatives from different rival political parties, which is also very difficult, it'd still make a very little difference.", "Are they are signed by the voter? Does that mean that it can be possible to determine who voted for which party? At least in my country it violates the constitution. That's why it's not done here.", "It already uses Blockchain", "Yes, security is a constantly evolving game in the physical and digital world. I am glad to see how mature Estonia has become with evoting\n\nI will continue to sing their praises as long as it's warrented.

This week, citizens of European Union go to polls to vote in European Parliament elections. These are the second-largest democratic elections in the world, with **390 million** eligible voters, behind \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3 India (970M), and above \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 United States (235M), \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\udde9 Indonesia (205M) and \ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf0 Pakistan (129M).\n\nEuropean Parliament is unicameral and will consist (after these elections) of 720 members (MEPs; 361 needed for majority), who are elected for a **five**-year term, in a mixed voting system, as each country has rules of its own. Read more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_European_Parliament_election). Few things worth knowing, or interesting:\n\n* Election takes four days, as it already finished in \ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddf1 Netherlands (which voted on Thursday 6th) and \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddea Ireland (Friday 7th). Few countries (Czechia, Latvia, Malta and Slovakia) vote on Friday-Saturday or Saturday only. However, overwhelming majority of countries (and people) will cast their votes on Sunday 9th.\n\n* Voting (in general, not only to the EP) is compulsory in five countries: \ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddea Belgium, \ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddec Bulgaria, \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddfe Cyprus, \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\uddf7 Greece and \ud83c\uddf1\ud83c\uddfa Luxembourg (albeit enforcement varies). Coincidentally, first two also hold national elections this Sunday - links to dedicated threads (if not stickied) will be linked below this post.\n\n* Majority of countries use proportional voting systems (D'Hondt, largest remainder or Sainte-Lagu\u00eb), two outliers are \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddea Ireland and \ud83c\uddf2\ud83c\uddf9 Malta, which both use STV. \n\n* Largest number of MEPs will be elected in \ud83c\udde9\ud83c\uddea Germany (96), \ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddf7 France (81), \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf9 Italy (76), \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8 Spain (61) and \ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf1 Poland (53). Lower end consists of \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddfe Cyprus, \ud83c\uddf1\ud83c\uddfa Luxembourg and \ud83c\uddf2\ud83c\uddf9 Malta, who elect 6 MEPs each.\n\n* Nearly all (23 of 27) countries vote as single constituency. \ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddea Belgium and \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddea Ireland vote in three constituencies each, \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf9 Italy in five, and major weirdo here is \ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf1 Poland, divided into 13 districts.\n\nTurnout in last (2019) elections was 50.7%.\n\nWhat can be a little confusing, is that while voters generally vote on candidates of various national parties, MEPs eventually are divided between various EP groups, which are usually based on one, two or more [European parties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_political_party), gathering respective national ones. Since 2014 elections, these European parties nominate their candidates to the office of [European Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission) president, who are commonly known as (from German) *Spitzenkandidat*.\n\nRelevant EP groups (European parties), present or expected to appear in the parliament, are:\n\nEP group (Europarties)|Spitzenkandidat|Position|Major national

I can understand that the current policy has failed here and that changes need to be made. While the far right promises these changes, there are points in their programs that are to the de facto disadvantage of all:\n\n- Many of Europe's right-wingers are financed by Russia. This creates a conflict of interest with a power that is genuinely hostile to us. Of course those who are far in to the deep end of Russian-fueled disinformation will not see this as a problem, but everyone else should.\n\n- Most of them are car-brains and I have yet to see a viable, sustainable transport concept in any of their election manifestos. They are mainly against public transport and cycle paths and for car-friendly inner cities with sufficient parking facilities. Car-friendly inner cities are to the detriment of everyone, including motorists. Of course there are a few who idealize the US-style suburbia where most drive a huge truck, but I would say the vast majority of Europeans love their compact, historic town centres.\n\n- Europe's far right is riddled with climate change deniers. It is one thing to criticize current energy policies, but many of them deny global warming altogether. That is no longer justified criticism, it is a delusion of reality. Of course there are some nutjobs who agree with this, but the vast majority of us have noticed it has gotten a lot warmer in recent years and that we need to do something about it.\n\n- The situation is similar with vaccinations. It is one thing to be against mandatory vaccination, but to deny the general benefits of vaccinations and demonize them is grossly negligent towards the health of the population. Of course there are people who bought into the disinformation and think vaccinations are the devil and cause autism or even death, but the vast majority of us like living without diseases around us that we thought were a thing of the past.\n\n- But this is perhaps the biggest red flag why no one in their right mind should vote for them: Europe's far right have, where they have gotten into power, via laws \"reformed\" the media and the judiciary to no longer act independently but to adhere to party line (Hungary, Poland, Italy). If you believe that these actions of these far right governments were a good thing, you no longer believe in democracy. If you believe that the media and judiciary are already controlled by the left wing through the shadows, how does passing actual laws to let the far right officially control them out in the open make it any better? And how is the judiciary being in line with the government benefitting anyone but the ultra-rich?\n\nThere are even more reasons for me personally not to ever want to vote for any of these parties (Euroscepticism, economic policy, education, for example), but I can see how some of their policies might be of advantage for a few voters. However, the reasons mentioned above are really to the de facto disadvantage of all and at most an advantage for the feelings of some.\n\nI know this will not appeal to those who are already far in the conspiracy deep end.
